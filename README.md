# Server for PandaBlogger

## Project description

This is the server for a minimal telegram-styled blog site.

## Installation

- Download or clone the repo
- In the terminal navigate to the `server` folder and run docker compose up
- Once the server is running open `client\index.html` to see the create-blog-post home-screen

## Usage

This blog gives users the ability to write a post with a title, a pseudonym and a body.
When the user hits 'publish', the post is stored in a database and the client is redirected to their posts path.
The user can then access their post using that show path, even after a server restart.

### Available Routes

Below are the routes available for use with the right usage:

- `/posts` GET method will retrieve all posts
- `/posts/:id` GET method will retrieve single post taking the post id as the parameter.
- `/posts` POST method will post a new post to the database.
